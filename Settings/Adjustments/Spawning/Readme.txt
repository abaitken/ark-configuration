Tired of the polarized level spawn weights on official maps and spending hours trying to find that max level tame you've been hunting for? The following code equalizes the spawn weights of all creature levels, giving any one level a 3.33% chance (1 in 30) to spawn. Huge credit and thanks to /u/mgxts for the original data dumps; this would not have been possible without his scripts.

To equalize levels, simply copy the code found in the Pastebin and paste it into your Game.ini (located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\ARK\ShooterGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor on PC).

Please note that The Island and Aberration are working properly, but Scorched still has some kinks in the code that need to be identified and dealt with - use at your own discretion, as certain creatures may or may not spawn.

Hello all. Nearly two years ago, I posted a collection of .ini settings that balance Dino level spawning across The Island, Scorched Earth, and Aberration. After a length hiatus, I've gone back and added entries for both Extinction and Genesis: Part 1. The following code equalizes the spawn weights of all creature levels on a given map, giving any one level a 3.33% chance (1 in 30) to spawn, which is contrary to the default spawning conditions of story ARK maps (which only allows specific level permutations to spawn) and more in-line with the non-canon maps like Ragnarok.

Please note that while the first three maps have been tested extensively, Extinction and Genesis have not. If there is an issue (overspawning, underspawning, or a missing entry), please inform me immediately so that the code may be corrected. I must give enormous thanks to /u/Montantero for their assistance in this endeavor, as it would not have been possible without them.
