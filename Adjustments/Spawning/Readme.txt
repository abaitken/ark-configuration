Tired of the polarized level spawn weights on official maps and spending hours trying to find that max level tame you've been hunting for? The following code equalizes the spawn weights of all creature levels, giving any one level a 3.33% chance (1 in 30) to spawn. Huge credit and thanks to /u/mgxts for the original data dumps; this would not have been possible without his scripts.

To equalize levels, simply copy the code found in the Pastebin and paste it into your Game.ini (located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\ARK\ShooterGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor on PC).

The Island - https://pastebin.com/jY309tYb

Scorched Earth - https://pastebin.com/K9bgpHB7

Aberration - https://pastebin.com/CZhU1jXG

Please note that The Island and Aberration are working properly, but Scorched still has some kinks in the code that need to be identified and dealt with - use at your own discretion, as certain creatures may or may not spawn.
